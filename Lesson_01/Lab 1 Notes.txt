The things I learned today in my first lab was how to compile and run my file. At first I had alot of code 2 errors showing up and it had me in a setback. 
But I figured out that I needed to put in in1.8.0_05/bxt/javac format in order for the filed to properly compile. 
I also learned how to set up a basic print statment which is System.out.println (" ")

â€¢	Why  was ASCII created:
Characters were used instead of graphics marks
	ASCII were  good at marking clear divisions between printing jobs 

\n = return for new line
\t =inset a tab at this point
\b	Insert a backspace in the text at this point.
\"	Insert a double quote character in the text at this point.
\\	Insert a backslash character in the text at this point.
